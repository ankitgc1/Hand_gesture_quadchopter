# Hand_gesture_quadchopter

### Project description:-
   Build hand gesture controlled quadcopter. Arduino, MPU-6050 (gyro+accelerometer) IMU sensor, NRF module, ultrasonic sensors were mainly used components in the project. MPU-6050 was used to detect hand gesture to control quadcopterâ€™s roll, pitch, and yaw. The potentiometer was used for throttle.  NRF module ware used for wireless communication.

### Last processing
First, Finish your drone assembly. Here is one good video on drone assembly. You can follow this link.

After Finishing the drone assembly. Just finish all your connections.
In "[nrf_gy_trans](https://github.com/ankitgc1/Hand_gesture_quadchopter/tree/master/nrf_gy_trans)" file has transmitter code, and "[nrf_recv](https://github.com/ankitgc1/Hand_gesture_quadchopter/tree/master/nrf_recv)" file has transmitter code. The codes are pretty self-explaining. Upload the respective codes in their Arduinos.
